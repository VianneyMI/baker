Once the temperature has been reached, add the rennet and stir well. Let it cook until it solidifies (about 1 and a half hours), then cut in 1x1cm squares. Let it rest for half an hour. Pour the cheese into the cheesecloth and il drip until it has completely separated from the liquid part (whey). Place the cheese into the recipient. Cover both sides of the cheese with coarse salt, repeat this operation twice, waiting 1 hour between two saltings. Store in the fridge.  ### Aging (optional) Store the cheese in a chill place (around 12\u00b0C). Every day of aging, flip the cheese upside-down. For the first two weeks, also cover it with oil and vinegar every day.  ## Extra: Uses for the whey You might have noticed you've obtained way more whey than cheese, it's normal, so you probably want to use it in some way instead of throwing it away.  If they like acids, you can feed it to your plants: it's pretty much giving them water and fertilizer in one go, you can feed it to your animals, since it's a great source of proteins, it's the prime ingredient of another cheese called \"Ricotta\", it can be used instead of water in sever recipes, and many other: you can even drink it. People have engineered ways to use the whey since the dawn of cheese.","28":"1. The basic rule of thumb I use for pasta is 100g, 1 egg per person 2. For this recipe you can go two ways, the old school \"well\" method or a kitchen aid mixer (skip to step 7) 3. For the well method, pile the flour onto the counter and with your hand carve a hole or a well in the center 4. Crack the eggs into the center of the well, and drizzle a bit of olive oil into the center 5. With a fork, begin slowly breaking up, mixing, and incorporating the egg into the flour until there is no longer any loose egg that can escape the outer well border 6. At this point use your hands to bring the sandy mixture together and knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth 7. For the stand mixer method just throw all the ingredients into the mixer with a dough hook and set it to level 4 for about 3-5 minutes and it will be done 8. You might need to scrape the sides down and maybe hand knead the dough a bit longer after it's done to make it into a nice smooth ball 9. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge a bit so it's easier to roll out (15-30 mins) 10. While the dough is resting, make the filling by first mixing the ricotta and egg into a bowl 11. Zest and juice a lemon peel into the bowl 12. Optionally add seafood ingredients at this point 13. Grate the Pecorino into the bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and mix to distribute the ingredients evenly 14. Take out the dough and cut it into 4 pieces, keeping the ones not currently being worked on covered so they don't dry out 15. Roll the dough out with a pasta machine down to the point where you can just barely see your hand through it (setting 2-3 out of 7) or roll it out with a rolling pin into a long sheet, maybe like 16 x 8 inches or so 16. At this point you can either cut the sheet in half and make two sheets, a top and bottom, or one sheet, where you will fold the dough over and use the folded seam as one side of the ravioli ![Lobster Ravioli](\/pix\/ravioli-02.webp) 17. Using a teaspoon, evenly space out the ricotta filling onto the sheets, leaving a few inches on each side for the seams 18. As stated in step 16, either take the 2nd sheet and place it over top or fold over the dough and press down firmly, forcing out any air and making sure the two pieces of dough stick 19. You may need to brush some water onto the dough if it is too heavily floured and not sticking 20. Using a fancy pasta cutter, a knife, or even a pizza cutter, cut evenly between the seams of the raviolis to separate them 21. If you used a pasta cutter, you are now done, store the raviolis on a floured wax paper sheet or freeze them for later ![Finished Ravioli](\/pix\/ravioli-03.webp) 22. If you don't have a pasta cutter, use a fork to press down the dough around the edges of the cut raviolis to ensure they are firmly closed and no leaks or air bubbles are visible, or else they will explode when cooked 23. To cook, throw them in salted boiling water and they will let you know when they're done when they float to the top (1-2 minutes) 24. Serve the seafood version with a simple fresh red sauce and basil, or spice it up a bit and go with a base of red sauce with some added heavy cream, and a pinch of red pepper flakes to make a pink sauce for the seafood version ![Served Ravioli](\/pix\/ravioli-04.webp)","29":"1.

Transfer to freezer for longer term storage. ## Notes * Instant yeast is not recommended as you can't easily tell if the bread will come to life. * For whole wheat version use 2 cups of whole wheat bread and 1 and 3\/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour. * Add sunflower seeds and\/or rolled oats for extra flavor\/grains. * For buns or rolls divide dough into smaller pieces before second rest. Shape them and then let the dough rest. Recommended lowering oven temperature to 350 F and not using water as those will result in a hard crust and potentially dry interior.","87":"1.

(The easiest way to peel the squash while raw is to cut it into strips and cut the skin off of each strip individually) 2. Chop your onion and garlic and cook in an oiled stock pot until translucent. 3. Once your onions are translucent add both cans of coconut milk to the pot along with your cubes of squash. Let simmer until squash is soft. 4. When your squash is soft take a potato masher and mash about half of your squash leaving the rest of it as cubes. 5. Take off heat and serve over rice.","95":"1. Bring 1 L of water in a pot to a boil. 2. Burn black bread in a toaster or in an oven until it is thoroughly scorched to blackness on the outside. 3. Once the water has come to boil, remove off heat. Add burned black bread, a handful of raisins, a few slices of lemon, and coffee beans to the pot. 4. Leave contents of the pot to cool down to room temperature. 5. Filter out everything from the pot through a strainer, and pour contents into a separate, sterilized container. Add sugar and yeast into the container, and stir until sugar is dissolved. This starts the fermentation process. The amount of sugar in this recipe should yield 1.0%-2.5% alcohol by total volume at the end of the fermentation process. 6. Add rest of raisins, and non-citrus fruits of your choice. The fruits will positively impact flavour of the final product. 7. If mixture is not already in a mason jar, pour the mixture into a sterile mason jar, and seal the lid. Place the jar in a warm place (26-30\u00b0C; 79-86\u00b0F), and let it ferment for a week, or until it stops bubbling. 8. Remove all raisins and fruits from the jar. 9. Squeeze lemon juice from lemons into the mixture. You may drink the now-complete kvass right away, or refrigerate it before drinking.","96":"1. Combine sourdough starter with warm water, break apart and dissolve. 2. Add flour and mix together gently to hydrate. Mixture will be very wet and sticky. 3. Once there is no dry flour, let stand for 30 minutes (autolyze). 4. Add sea salt. 5. Wet hands and begin to stretch and fold dough to combine salt and to begin gluten formation. 6. Add drops of water until dough becomes cohesive and supple with no toughness or resistance. 7. Dough will prove on the counter top for 4 - 5 hours. About every 30 minutes, perform a stretch and fold. This involves grabbing the dough with a wet hand, folding over the top of itself, and repeating this step by turning the bowl and making your way around the dough. It will take some practice to work with a dough of this level of hydration, but will get easier! 8. You will know fermentation is complete when small bubbles are seen on the surface around the edge of your dough. You can also perform a window pane test by grasping a pinch of dough and pulling it between your fingers. The dough should stretch enough to become see-through. This means enough gluten has formed that the dough is strong enough to hold large air bubbles as it bakes. 9. Turn onto generously floured surface using a bowl scraper or spatula to protect the dough. Handling the dough gently will prevent deflation. 10. Shape the dough: Take the two sides and fold them into the center of the wet dough. Then, take the top and bottom and fold them also over the center of the wet dough. Optional: grasp the edge of the dough closest to you and roll dough away from you into a tight loaf shape. Generously flour. 11. Place into a dish about the size of the dough, a proving basket is ideal. Use a lot of flour in the bowl and on the loaf. The sides of the container should not be shallow, the goal here is to let the bread rest in the shape you want it to bake in. 12. Refrigerate 12 - 24 hours, the longer the dough rests, the more sour your final product. I don't recommend going over 24 hours but sour dough is fun to experiment with! 13. Bring dough to room temperature, it should feel like a water balloon, giving resistance to touch with some spring. 14. Put one oven rack in the center and another below it, place a pan of water on the lower rack. Preheat oven to 475 - 500 degrees F, depending on oven capability. The pan of water should create steam to help the bread expand. 15. When oven is hot, turn bread into a baking vessel. I use a 8 inch springform pan, but a dutch oven is ideal. You can use any vessel that is rated for high temperatures. If using a dutch oven, keep it covered for the first 15 minutes, and you don't need to use the pan of water. 16. Flour the top of the loaf and score the bread with a razor blade (this is optional but creates an artisan look) 17. Bake covered\/steamed for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 425 F. If using steam, remove the water pan now. 18. Bake for another 25 - 30 minutes until crust is a rusty color and sounds hollow when tapped. 19. Let bread cool completely before slicing. (if you can wait!)","97":"1. Bake the potatoes at 450\u00b0 for about an hour. 2. Take them out and leave them to cool for a good 10 minutes. 3. Begin heating up a big pot to about medium temperature, and put the butter in to melt. 4. Cut the potatoes in half and scoop them directly into the pot. 5. Once you are finished with that, begin mashing them until they are a nice mashed-potato-like consistency. 6. Add milk little by little, stirring as you go, until you reach the desired consistency. I usually use half a gallon or so. 7. Shred cheese into the soup. Then add garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne, onion greens, and anything else you can think of. 9. Let the soup reach a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and serve. 10. I usually eat it with sour cream mixed in to cool it down and get that extra dairy in.","98":"### Preparing the fish 1. Turn the creature on its back. With a sharp and preferably short-bladed knife make an incision from the anus to just between the two small fins under the head. This is best done by inserting the knife blade tip facing up while putting force upwards and moving towards the head, letting gravity do the work. This helps to avoid puncturing the organs. 2. Remove the organs. Gently pull and cut the membrane that connects each to the rest of the body. 3. Make an incision around the mouth (the hard 'lips'), turn the fish around and do the same to that side. 4. Start to slowly but firmly pull back the skin cutting whenever there is resistance as you make your way towards the tail. 5. Once you have removed the skin, flip it back onto its back and cut off the thin flabs of meat of its underside and fins from the body. At this point there should be a clear distinction between the body and the larger head. Behead the animal. 6. With a filleting knife, fillet the meat from the backbone and remove the tail. 7. You should be left with 2 long strips of meat. Cut each in half. ### Cooking 8. In a pan on medium heat, melt a good amount of butter and place the fillets inside. The goal here is to sear the meat to get that light crust. Flip until all sides have turned the 'golden brown' color. 9. Add the herbs, just enough to cover the fillets, salt and pepper too if desired and cover with the lid on low heat until fully cooked. Time here varies but it can be anywhere between 5-10 minutes. 10. Enjoy. This goes well with steamed vegetables. Or potatoes to soak up the butter. ![served](\/pix\/fried-anglerfish-fillet-01.webp)","99":"1. Set oven heat to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). 2.

Drizzle the fries with olive oil. Toss the fries with clean hands to coat the fries in olive oil. Now wash your hands with soap to remove excess olive oil. 5. Top generously with cinnamon and salt. Pepper and\/or rosemary may be added for additional flavor if desired. 6. Put in preheated oven. Setting timer for 20 minutes. 7. At 20 minutes, flip the fries. Rubber tongs make it easy to grab and turn a lot. 8. Return to oven setting timer for another 10-20 minutes depending on quality of the oven and desired crispiness. 9. Enjoy. Maybe them put in a glass bowl. ## Notes * A fast method to cut the the sweet pototoes is first into fourths, slice the fourths, chops the sliced layers while stacked into fries. * If you want to experiment with a variety of fats, consider combining the olive oil with grass-fed butter and coconut oil. I believe the issue with coconut oil is it likes being cooked at lower temperatures or else the health quality of the oil will degrade.","100":"1.

Season the fillet with salt and black pepper. 2. With a nicely-oiled pan on high heat, sear the fillet on all sides, including the ends. For the standard medium-rare beef wellington, do not cook the fillet, just sear it, tough if you want something more cooked than medium-rare, it's wise to give it more heat here. Put it aside on a plate. 3. Brush the fillet with yellow mustard *immediatly* after taking it out of the pan. This allows the musturd's flavour to be absorbed by the fillet and thus preserve a mildly hot flavor. 4. Chop the mushrooms. Put them in a food processor. Transfer the pur\u00e9e to a saut\u00e9 pan that has been heated to medium high heat to cook.

He was too proud to beg for a bite to eat, so instead, he requested a large pot in which he could make \u201ca delicious and filling\u2026\u2026.stone soup\u201d. With arched eyebrows and curious glances, the family invited him into their home and set up a large pot over flickering flames and filled with water. Slowly walking up to the ironclad cauldron, the friar reached into his deep pocket to produce a smooth and well-cleaned stone that he promptly dropped into the boiling water. A little while later he tasted the soup and said that it needed a touch of seasoning. So the wife brought him some salt to add, to which he suggested that maybe a little bit of chouri\u00e7o (sausage), or pork belly, would be better. Graciously, she obliged and dropped several thick slices into the pot. Then, the friar asked if she might not have a little something to enrich the soup, such as potatoes or beans from a previous meal. With a broad smile, she agreed, and added a healthy portion into the bubbling water. This banter continued back and forth between the family and the friar before he finally announced that he had indeed made a very delicious and filling soup. When the soup was done, the friar fished the stone out of the pot, washed and dried it off, and plopped it back in his pocket for the next time. > - According to the people of Almeirim","121":"1.

Set a wok or pot over medium-low heat and add the peanut oil about 1 to 2 inches up the pot. Set a thermometer to monitor the temperature to reach 315 F (157 C). 2. Wash the exterior of the potato. Using a mandolin set on 2 mm (~1\/16th inch), a very sharp knife or a potato peeler cut the potatoes into thin chip slices. 3. Add the potatoes to the hot oil and cook for 9 to 11 minutes while stirring fairly constantly. <br> Note: The oil should drop to roughly 250 F in the first few minutes before stabilizing and increasing back to 315 F. This may be slightly different depending on the size of the pot and the amount of oil you use. 4. Once golden browned and completely crisp with no bubbling, remove the chips with a slotted spoon and add to a paper towel over a wire rack to absorb excess oil. Seasoning immediately with salt and any seasoning of your choice. 5. Don't throw away your oil! Let it cool. Place a paper towel in a metal strainer and strain it into a glass or plastic container for next time. ## Seasoning suggestion - Ethan suggests making a special seasoning from jalape\u00f1os, onions, garlic, salt and (optional) some MSG. This optional step takes a LOT longer than the rest of the recipe. 1. Dry out the vegetables after cutting and preparing them, sliced quite thin so that they dry out, in the oven at the lowest temperature that it will go to. 2. Leave for about 6 hours to dry in the oven. 3. Once dry and brittle, break the vegetables up into little pieces. 4. Powder them in a mortar and pestle until completely dry and fine. 5. Pour powder into a separate bowl. 6. Add a spoonfull of salt and (optional) a small amount of MSG to the mortar and pestle. Grind to the same consistency as the vegetables. 7. Add the salt-msg mix to the vegetable powder along with about half a tablespoon of sugar 8. Sprinkle over the chips and mix well. Enjoy!","124":"2.

Let the mixture get warm for a few minutes under constant stirring. 5. Reduce heat to medium-high. Form the R\u00f6sti into a round cack. It should fill   out the whole pan. I recommend a thickness of around 1 - 1.5cm (~1\/2\") for a   softer R\u00f6sti. 6. Add some more butter flakes around the inside of the pan to get it under the   R\u00f6sti. 7. It can take quite a while for a nice crust to form. Check after roughly 5-10   minutes for browning. 8. While the R\u00f6sti is cooking dice the other onion and the carrots. Steam   everything in a pan with a bit of water. Use a lid to get the temperature   up. 9. Alternatively you can use fresh or creamed spinach. 10. When you're satisfied with the browning, flip the R\u00f6sti and set the heat to   medium-low. A plate can be useful here, put it on top of the R\u00f6sti in the   pan and flip. Then gently put the whole cake back in the pan. 11. When the R\u00f6sti crispness is to your liking, remove from pan and fry two   eggs. A runny yolk adds quite a bit to the potatoes. 12.

Place garbanzo beans in a small saucepan or pot, add 1 teaspoon baking soda (this alters the pH to encourage the beans to break down and shed their skins), and cover with a few inches of water. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes, until the skins begin to fall off and the beans look overcooked\/mushy. You may need to reduce the heat after a few minutes to prevent boil-overs. 3. While the garbanzo beans are boiling, combine the garlic and lemon juice with 1\/4 teaspoon salt in the workbowl of your food processor. Pulse until a fine, uniform consistency is achieved. You may need to scrape down the top and sides of the bowl to ensure the garlic is chopped finely enough. Leave the mixture for at least 10 minutes for the raw garlic taste to mellow. 4. After 20 minutes of boiling, drain the garbanzo beans and their skins in a mesh strainer, then rinse for at least 30 seconds with cold water to remove any lingering taste from the baking soda. 5. Add the tahini to the food processor. Blend until creamy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. 6. While the food processor is running on \"high,\" slowly drizzle in two tablespoons of ice-cold water. Continue to run on high, scraping down the bowl as necessary (1-3 times), until the mixture has enough air worked into it that it lightens in color and thickens in texture substantially. 7. Scrape down the bowl again, then add the garbanzo beans and cumin (and za'atar, if you have it). Pulse a few times, then set the food processor to high again. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, as slowly as you can manage. 8. Continue to process the hummus on high for at least one minute longer, up to three minutes longer if it hasn't become smooth enough yet. You can make the hummus thinner at this point by slowly adding ice water a teaspoon at a time while processing on high. Taste the hummus at this point to determine if it needs more lemon juice or more salt for flavor. 9. Transfer the hummus into a serving bowl and smooth out the surface with the back of a spoon, creating swirls or indentations for olive oil as desired. Top with additional olive oil and optionally finely chopped fresh parsley, more za'atar, or a sprinkling of sumac (a spice mixture) or dukkah (a seed mixture). 10.

Browning the meat on the outside will give it a much nicer texture when you go to eat this and **should not be skipped for convenience**. 3. Remove the meat and add in the vegetables. Adding some salt will help remove the moisture in the veg and will help deglaze the caramelised bits at the bottom of the pot. 4.

The basic rule of thumb I use for pasta is 100g, 1 egg per person 2. For this recipe you can go two ways, the old school \"well\" method or a kitchen aid mixer (skip to step 7) 3. For the well method, pile the flour onto the counter and with your hand carve a hole or a well in the center 4. Crack the eggs into the center of the well, and drizzle a bit of olive oil into the center 5. With a fork, begin slowly breaking up, mixing, and incorporating the egg into the flour until there is no longer any loose egg that can escape the outer well border 6. At this point use your hands to bring the sandy mixture together and knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth 7. For the stand mixer method just throw all the ingredients into the mixer with a dough hook and set it to level 4 for about 3-5 minutes and it will be done 8. You might need to scrape the sides down and maybe hand knead the dough a bit longer after it's done to make it into a nice smooth ball 9. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge a bit so it's easier to roll out (15-30 mins) 10. While the dough is resting, make the filling by first mixing the ricotta and egg into a bowl 11. Zest and juice a lemon peel into the bowl 12. Optionally add seafood ingredients at this point 13. Grate the Pecorino into the bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and mix to distribute the ingredients evenly 14. Take out the dough and cut it into 4 pieces, keeping the ones not currently being worked on covered so they don't dry out 15. Roll the dough out with a pasta machine down to the point where you can just barely see your hand through it (setting 2-3 out of 7) or roll it out with a rolling pin into a long sheet, maybe like 16 x 8 inches or so 16. At this point you can either cut the sheet in half and make two sheets, a top and bottom, or one sheet, where you will fold the dough over and use the folded seam as one side of the ravioli ![Lobster Ravioli](\/pix\/ravioli-02.webp) 17. Using a teaspoon, evenly space out the ricotta filling onto the sheets, leaving a few inches on each side for the seams 18. As stated in step 16, either take the 2nd sheet and place it over top or fold over the dough and press down firmly, forcing out any air and making sure the two pieces of dough stick 19. You may need to brush some water onto the dough if it is too heavily floured and not sticking 20. Using a fancy pasta cutter, a knife, or even a pizza cutter, cut evenly between the seams of the raviolis to separate them 21.

Boil 1-2l of water. 2. Rinse all the dishes you will be working with boiling water; this is   important so the brew doesn't go bad while fermenting. 3. Steep 3-5 tbsp (or 5-6 bags) of tee in 3-5 cups of water. 4. Strain the leaves from the tea and add 2 cups of sugar (or honey). 5. Add other optional teas to your liking; I like to add a good handful of   rosella tea; steep and strain this in boiling water separately. 6. Add 4l of water to the tea concentrate and pour into a wide mouthed jar. 7. Let the tea sit until it is less than 40\u00b0C; add ice cubes if it has to go   quick. 8. Add your scoby to the jar and seal the mouth tightly with a cloth or paper   towel and a rubber band. The scoby has to breathe, but you want to prevent   insects and dirt from getting into the jar. 9. Let the jar sit in a warm dark spot for 10-14 days. Second brew: 1. Taste the brew after 10-14 days; if it has started to carbonate and the   sugar is mostly gone, it is ready. The brewing time will strongly depend on   your personal preference, shorten or lengthen as you wish. 2. Once ready, strain 4\/5 of the brew through a sieve into re-sealable glass   bottles. 3. Make another batch of primary brew and refill the big jar; the remaining old   brew will act as a starter. Rinse the jar and remove parts of the scoby once   in a while. 4. If you wish you can add juices, fruits, or spices to your brew. These will   partially ferment and add a special character to your kombucha. One nice   addition is apple and cinnamon mixed in with green tea. 5. Let the bottles sit in a warm dark spot for another 3-14 days; the   carbonation process will continue, so make sure to release pressure from the   bottles every other day. 6. When you are satisfied with the carbonation and the flavor, put the bottles   in the fridge. Here you can store them for weeks at a time. 7. Enjoy your kombucha, rinse, and repeat."},"89":{"title":"Shakshouka","ingredients":"- 5 small tomatoes - 5 eggs - 1 peeled white onion - some chives - cumin - powdered sweet pepper","direction":"1.

Filter out everything from the pot through a strainer, and pour contents into a separate, sterilized container. Add sugar and yeast into the container, and stir until sugar is dissolved. This starts the fermentation process. The amount of sugar in this recipe should yield 1.0%-2.5% alcohol by total volume at the end of the fermentation process. 6. Add rest of raisins, and non-citrus fruits of your choice. The fruits will positively impact flavour of the final product. 7.

Combine sourdough starter with warm water, break apart and dissolve. 2. Add flour and mix together gently to hydrate. Mixture will be very wet and sticky. 3. Once there is no dry flour, let stand for 30 minutes (autolyze). 4. Add sea salt. 5. Wet hands and begin to stretch and fold dough to combine salt and to begin gluten formation. 6. Add drops of water until dough becomes cohesive and supple with no toughness or resistance. 7. Dough will prove on the counter top for 4 - 5 hours. About every 30 minutes, perform a stretch and fold. This involves grabbing the dough with a wet hand, folding over the top of itself, and repeating this step by turning the bowl and making your way around the dough. It will take some practice to work with a dough of this level of hydration, but will get easier! 8. You will know fermentation is complete when small bubbles are seen on the surface around the edge of your dough. You can also perform a window pane test by grasping a pinch of dough and pulling it between your fingers. The dough should stretch enough to become see-through. This means enough gluten has formed that the dough is strong enough to hold large air bubbles as it bakes. 9. Turn onto generously floured surface using a bowl scraper or spatula to protect the dough. Handling the dough gently will prevent deflation. 10. Shape the dough: Take the two sides and fold them into the center of the wet dough. Then, take the top and bottom and fold them also over the center of the wet dough. Optional: grasp the edge of the dough closest to you and roll dough away from you into a tight loaf shape. Generously flour. 11. Place into a dish about the size of the dough, a proving basket is ideal. Use a lot of flour in the bowl and on the loaf. The sides of the container should not be shallow, the goal here is to let the bread rest in the shape you want it to bake in. 12. Refrigerate 12 - 24 hours, the longer the dough rests, the more sour your final product. I don't recommend going over 24 hours but sour dough is fun to experiment with! 13. Bring dough to room temperature, it should feel like a water balloon, giving resistance to touch with some spring. 14. Put one oven rack in the center and another below it, place a pan of water on the lower rack. Preheat oven to 475 - 500 degrees F, depending on oven capability. The pan of water should create steam to help the bread expand. 15. When oven is hot, turn bread into a baking vessel. I use a 8 inch springform pan, but a dutch oven is ideal. You can use any vessel that is rated for high temperatures. If using a dutch oven, keep it covered for the first 15 minutes, and you don't need to use the pan of water. 16. Flour the top of the loaf and score the bread with a razor blade (this is optional but creates an artisan look) 17. Bake covered\/steamed for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 425 F. If using steam, remove the water pan now. 18. Bake for another 25 - 30 minutes until crust is a rusty color and sounds hollow when tapped. 19. Let bread cool completely before slicing.

Turn the creature on its back. With a sharp and preferably short-bladed knife make an incision from the anus to just between the two small fins under the head. This is best done by inserting the knife blade tip facing up while putting force upwards and moving towards the head, letting gravity do the work. This helps to avoid puncturing the organs. 2. Remove the organs. Gently pull and cut the membrane that connects each to the rest of the body. 3. Make an incision around the mouth (the hard 'lips'), turn the fish around and do the same to that side. 4. Start to slowly but firmly pull back the skin cutting whenever there is resistance as you make your way towards the tail. 5. Once you have removed the skin, flip it back onto its back and cut off the thin flabs of meat of its underside and fins from the body. At this point there should be a clear distinction between the body and the larger head. Behead the animal. 6. With a filleting knife, fillet the meat from the backbone and remove the tail. 7. You should be left with 2 long strips of meat. Cut each in half. ### Cooking 8. In a pan on medium heat, melt a good amount of butter and place the fillets inside. The goal here is to sear the meat to get that light crust. Flip until all sides have turned the 'golden brown' color. 9. Add the herbs, just enough to cover the fillets, salt and pepper too if desired and cover with the lid on low heat until fully cooked. Time here varies but it can be anywhere between 5-10 minutes. 10. Enjoy. This goes well with steamed vegetables.

I believe the issue with coconut oil is it likes being cooked at lower temperatures or else the health quality of the oil will degrade."},"100":{"title":"Teriyaki Beef Wok","ingredients":"- 2 dL water - 2 tbsp cornstarch - 1 tbsp honey - 1\/4 tsp ginger - 3 tbsp soy sauce - Sesame oil - Beef slices or strips - Carrot, sliced (optional) - Broccoli, florets (optional) - Baby corn (optional) - Water chestnut, sliced (optional) - Bean sprouts (optional) - Chili pepper, diced (optional) - Noodles or rice","direction":"1.

He was too proud to beg for a bite to eat, so instead, he requested a large pot in which he could make \u201ca delicious and filling\u2026\u2026.stone soup\u201d. With arched eyebrows and curious glances, the family invited him into their home and set up a large pot over flickering flames and filled with water. Slowly walking up to the ironclad cauldron, the friar reached into his deep pocket to produce a smooth and well-cleaned stone that he promptly dropped into the boiling water. A little while later he tasted the soup and said that it needed a touch of seasoning. So the wife brought him some salt to add, to which he suggested that maybe a little bit of chouri\u00e7o (sausage), or pork belly, would be better. Graciously, she obliged and dropped several thick slices into the pot. Then, the friar asked if she might not have a little something to enrich the soup, such as potatoes or beans from a previous meal. With a broad smile, she agreed, and added a healthy portion into the bubbling water. This banter continued back and forth between the family and the friar before he finally announced that he had indeed made a very delicious and filling soup. When the soup was done, the friar fished the stone out of the pot, washed and dried it off, and plopped it back in his pocket for the next time. > - According to the people of Almeirim"},"121":{"title":"Medieval Beef Soup","ingredients":"- One beef roast - Around three to four large turnips with their greens attached - Two cups of chicken stock - 1\/10 grams of Saffron - 1\/4 a stick of butter - A slow cooker - A bowl of warm water.","direction":"1.

Continue to process the hummus on high for at least one minute longer, up to three minutes longer if it hasn't become smooth enough yet. You can make the hummus thinner at this point by slowly adding ice water a teaspoon at a time while processing on high.

Browning the meat on the outside will give it a much nicer texture when you go to eat this and **should not be skipped for convenience**. 3. Remove the meat and add in the vegetables. Adding some salt will help remove the moisture in the veg and will help deglaze the caramelised bits at the bottom of the pot. 4.
