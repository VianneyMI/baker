I found it in a newspaper a while back and thought I'd share it with you guys because it's my favourite meal. I also like to drink the excess red wine while cooking which adds to the enjoyment of cooking. - \u23f2\ufe0f Prep time: 10 min - \ud83c\udf73 Cook time: 50 min - \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Servings: 4",
