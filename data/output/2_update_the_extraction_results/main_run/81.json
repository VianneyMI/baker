Add white coverture chocolate and macadamia and mix evenly with spatula. 6. Allow 30 minutes to 1 hour in the refrigerator until the dough hardens. 7. Pan with a 5cm diameter cookie and bake at 170\u00b0C (338\u00b0F) for 9 minutes. (Unox convection oven) * Preheat the oven beforehand. My oven is very hot, so raise the oven temperature a little bit higher if you have common oven. * If you bake too little, it will not be cooked. If you bake too long, it will become hard. * The white coverture chocolate melts smoothly in your mouth, and the white chocolate chip has a more chewy texture. So you can choose anything to your taste."
