    "introduction": "![Kettle Corn](/pix/kettlecorn.webp \"Kettle Corn made with brown sugar\") Recipe can be expanded or contracted to your needs. I personally divide the recipe in half to fit my 2 quart saucepan (recipe calls for a 3 quart). I recommend using Orville Redenbacher's popcorn kernels, as they are specifically formulated to pop consistently. Follow these directions precisely, and I will guarantee you will have no burnt or unpopped kernels. - \u23f2\ufe0f Prep time: 2 min - \ud83c\udf73 Cook time: 5 min - \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Serving 14",
    "ingredients_source_text": "- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or oil of your choice - 1/4 cup of popcorn kernels - 2 tablespoons of sugar (brown sugar works too) - salt to taste",
    "directions_source_text": "1. Add oil into your saucepan and 3 popcorn kernels. 2. Cover with lid and set stove to medium-high heat. 3. Once all 3 kernels pop, add in the rest of your kernels and shake to coat in oil. Pour sugar directly onto the kernels. 4. Shake the pot for 3 seconds, rest for 3 seconds, and repeat till the kernels start to pop steadily. Depending on your stove, you may need to lift the pot to shake. 5. Once kernels start popping, shake pot every 1-2 seconds. 6. **Important**. Once you no longer hear pops for about 3 seconds, immediately transfer into a bowl to avoid burning."
