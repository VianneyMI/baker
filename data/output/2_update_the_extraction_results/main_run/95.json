    "introduction": "[Kvass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvass) is a Slavic fermented beverage which is both simple to make and rich in flavour. - \u23f2\ufe0f Prep time: ~30 min - \u231b Fermentation time: ~1 week",
    "ingredients_source_text": "- 100 g of raisins - 100 g of sugar - 3 slices of black bread (e.g. pumpernickel bread, rye bread) - 1-2 lemons - 1 pkg (7 g) of active dry yeast - *Optional:*  - *A handful of coffee beans*  - *Non-citrus fruits (e.g. plums, apples, kiwi)*",
    "directions_source_text": "1. Bring 1 L of water in a pot to a boil. 2. Burn black bread in a toaster or in an oven until it is thoroughly scorched to blackness on the outside. 3. Once the water has come to boil, remove off heat. Add burned black bread, a handful of raisins, a few slices of lemon, and coffee beans to the pot. 4. Leave contents of the pot to cool down to room temperature. 5. Filter out everything from the pot through a strainer, and pour contents into a separate, sterilized container. Add sugar and yeast into the container, and stir until sugar is dissolved. This starts the fermentation process. The amount of sugar in this recipe should yield 1.0%-2.5% alcohol by total volume at the end of the fermentation process. 6. Add rest of raisins, and non-citrus fruits of your choice. The fruits will positively impact flavour of the final product. 7. If mixture is not already in a mason jar, pour the mixture into a sterile mason jar, and seal the lid. Place the jar in a warm place (26-30\u00b0C; 79-86\u00b0F), and let it ferment for a week, or until it stops bubbling. 8. Remove all raisins and fruits from the jar. 9. Squeeze lemon juice from lemons into the mixture. You may drink the now-complete kvass right away, or refrigerate it before drinking."
