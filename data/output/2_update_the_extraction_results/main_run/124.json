Dice the first onion and mix together with potatoes. You can also add diced   bacon if you want to. Add your seasonings here. 4. Heat up some butter in a large pan. Add your mix to the pan on high heat.   Let the mixture get warm for a few minutes under constant stirring. 5. Reduce heat to medium-high. Form the R\u00f6sti into a round cack. It should fill   out the whole pan. I recommend a thickness of around 1 - 1.5cm (~1/2\") for a   softer R\u00f6sti. 6. Add some more butter flakes around the inside of the pan to get it under the   R\u00f6sti. 7. It can take quite a while for a nice crust to form. Check after roughly 5-10   minutes for browning. 8. While the R\u00f6sti is cooking dice the other onion and the carrots. Steam   everything in a pan with a bit of water. Use a lid to get the temperature   up. 9. Alternatively you can use fresh or creamed spinach. 10. When you're satisfied with the browning, flip the R\u00f6sti and set the heat to   medium-low. A plate can be useful here, put it on top of the R\u00f6sti in the   pan and flip. Then gently put the whole cake back in the pan. 11. When the R\u00f6sti crispness is to your liking, remove from pan and fry two   eggs. A runny yolk adds quite a bit to the potatoes. 12. Top R\u00f6sti with eggs and serve with the peas or spinach."
