    "introduction": "Credits to creator of recipe, Ethan Chlebowski, [(original recipe)](https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/cooking-techniques-recipes/kettle-cooked-chips). I decided to post it on here to be more available. - \u23f2\ufe0f Prep time: 3 min - \ud83c\udf73 Cook time: 11 min - \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Servings: 1~2, about 1 plate full",
    "ingredients_source_text": "- 1 Russet Potato, or other potato with high starch and low moisture. The amount of starch effects the crunchiness of the chip. - Peanut Oil for frying (at least 1 to 2 inches in the pan) - Salt or seasoning of your choice",
    "directions_source_text": "1. Set a wok or pot over medium-low heat and add the peanut oil about 1 to 2 inches up the pot. Set a thermometer to monitor the temperature to reach 315 F (157 C). 2. Wash the exterior of the potato. Using a mandolin set on 2 mm (~1/16th inch), a very sharp knife or a potato peeler cut the potatoes into thin chip slices. 3. Add the potatoes to the hot oil and cook for 9 to 11 minutes while stirring fairly constantly. <br> Note: The oil should drop to roughly 250 F in the first few minutes before stabilizing and increasing back to 315 F. This may be slightly different depending on the size of the pot and the amount of oil you use. 4. Once golden browned and completely crisp with no bubbling, remove the chips with a slotted spoon and add to a paper towel over a wire rack to absorb excess oil. Seasoning immediately with salt and any seasoning of your choice. 5. Don't throw away your oil! Let it cool. Place a paper towel in a metal strainer and strain it into a glass or plastic container for next time. ## Seasoning suggestion - Ethan suggests making a special seasoning from jalape\u00f1os, onions, garlic, salt and (optional) some MSG. This optional step takes a LOT longer than the rest of the recipe. 1. Dry out the vegetables after cutting and preparing them, sliced quite thin so that they dry out, in the oven at the lowest temperature that it will go to. 2. Leave for about 6 hours to dry in the oven. 3. Once dry and brittle, break the vegetables up into little pieces. 4. Powder them in a mortar and pestle until completely dry and fine. 5. Pour powder into a separate bowl. 6. Add a spoonfull of salt and (optional) a small amount of MSG to the mortar and pestle. Grind to the same consistency as the vegetables. 7. Add the salt-msg mix to the vegetable powder along with about half a tablespoon of sugar 8. Sprinkle over the chips and mix well. Enjoy!"
