For this recipe you can go two ways, the old school \"well\" method or a kitchen aid mixer (skip to step 7) 3. For the well method, pile the flour onto the counter and with your hand carve a hole or a well in the center 4. Crack the eggs into the center of the well, and drizzle a bit of olive oil into the center 5. With a fork, begin slowly breaking up, mixing, and incorporating the egg into the flour until there is no longer any loose egg that can escape the outer well border 6. At this point use your hands to bring the sandy mixture together and knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth 7. For the stand mixer method just throw all the ingredients into the mixer with a dough hook and set it to level 4 for about 3-5 minutes and it will be done 8. You might need to scrape the sides down and maybe hand knead the dough a bit longer after it's done to make it into a nice smooth ball 9. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge a bit so it's easier to roll out (15-30 mins) 10. While the dough is resting, make the filling by first mixing the ricotta and egg into a bowl 11. Zest and juice a lemon peel into the bowl 12. Optionally add seafood ingredients at this point 13. Grate the Pecorino into the bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and mix to distribute the ingredients evenly 14. Take out the dough and cut it into 4 pieces, keeping the ones not currently being worked on covered so they don't dry out 15. Roll the dough out with a pasta machine down to the point where you can just barely see your hand through it (setting 2-3 out of 7) or roll it out with a rolling pin into a long sheet, maybe like 16 x 8 inches or so 16.

You may need to brush some water onto the dough if it is too heavily floured and not sticking 20.
