    "introduction": "This is a recipe for a typical Irish stew. This is traditionally made with lamb since it's cheaper however, beef tastes a lot better and is more readily available in North America I've been told. This is good if you want to feed a family or if you just want to be lazy and eat the same thing for 2 or 3 days. Besides browning the meat this is really just throwing stuff into a pot in a certain order. This is the kind of dish that tastes better the next day so it's ideal for making on a Sunday and eating for the next 2 or 3 days. Serve with mashed potatoes.",
    "ingredients_source_text": "- Lamb shoulder or beef chuck - Onion, celery, carrot and garlic - Thyme, rosemary and some bay leaves. - Beef or [chicken stock](/chicken-stock-bone-broth) - (Optional) a bottle of stout or porter for some extra flavour.",
