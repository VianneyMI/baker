It is similar to strawberry jam or conserves in taste (less sweet/concentrated flavor), but resembles fruit punch in looks and consistency. It is very easy to adjust this recipe and scale it up/down. FYI, I suggest using organic strawberries for this (may be on the expensive side), it makes a world of difference in flavor.  - \u23f2\ufe0f Prep time: ~20 min - \ud83c\udf73 Cook time: 5-10 min - \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Servings: 16?
