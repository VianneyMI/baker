As a kid, you would eat P\u00e2t\u00e9 Chinois at least once a week, either at home or at the school's cafeteria,. It is very similar to a Shepherd\u2019s Pie, as it is divided in 3 layers of ingredients: meat, legumes and mashed potatoes. The literal translation of the name is something like _chinese pie_. You can search for the origin of the name on the internet, I'm not an history teacher. - \u23f2\ufe0f Prep time: 20 min - \ud83c\udf73 Cook time: 40-60 min - \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Servings: 6-8",

Serve with ketchup on top and with marinated beets on the side. ## Note - For a vegetarian alternative, you can replace the beef with 500g of fake meat and a can of 19oz of lentils (drain and washed). - This recipe can be easily double and you can also freeze it for lunches. - If you like mushrooms, you can brown 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms with the onions of the beef layer. - If you want to be wild, you can swap the corn layer with a mix of diced veges like black radishes, parsnips, carrots, turnips and/or cauliflower."
