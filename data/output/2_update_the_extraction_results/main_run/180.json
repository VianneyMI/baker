Heat the frying pan add a bit of oil, add the pork and onion, and fry for   about 10-15 minutes over medium-high heat. 4. While the pork and onion are being fried, cut the carrot into small pieces   and chop the parsley. 5. Once the pork and onion are fried, add the water, tomato paste, buckwheat and   carrots. 6.
