It is similar to strawberry jam or conserves in taste (less sweet/concentrated flavor), but resembles fruit punch in looks and consistency. It is very easy to adjust this recipe and scale it up/down. FYI, I suggest using organic strawberries for this (may be on the expensive side), it makes a world of difference in flavor.  - \u23f2\ufe0f Prep time: ~20 min - \ud83c\udf73 Cook time: 5-10 min - \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Servings: 16?

Dump out both packs of strawberries into a sieve or bowl and wash them thoroughly. 3. Remove the stem and leaves/crown of the strawberry. The crown can be peeled by hand, then use the butter knife to cut out the stem. 4. Large strawberries can be cut in half. 5.

For this recipe you can go two ways, the old school \"well\" method or a kitchen aid mixer (skip to step 7) 3. For the well method, pile the flour onto the counter and with your hand carve a hole or a well in the center 4. Crack the eggs into the center of the well, and drizzle a bit of olive oil into the center 5. With a fork, begin slowly breaking up, mixing, and incorporating the egg into the flour until there is no longer any loose egg that can escape the outer well border 6. At this point use your hands to bring the sandy mixture together and knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth 7. For the stand mixer method just throw all the ingredients into the mixer with a dough hook and set it to level 4 for about 3-5 minutes and it will be done 8. You might need to scrape the sides down and maybe hand knead the dough a bit longer after it's done to make it into a nice smooth ball 9. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge a bit so it's easier to roll out (15-30 mins) 10. While the dough is resting, make the filling by first mixing the ricotta and egg into a bowl 11. Zest and juice a lemon peel into the bowl 12. Optionally add seafood ingredients at this point 13. Grate the Pecorino into the bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and mix to distribute the ingredients evenly 14. Take out the dough and cut it into 4 pieces, keeping the ones not currently being worked on covered so they don't dry out 15. Roll the dough out with a pasta machine down to the point where you can just barely see your hand through it (setting 2-3 out of 7) or roll it out with a rolling pin into a long sheet, maybe like 16 x 8 inches or so 16.

You may need to brush some water onto the dough if it is too heavily floured and not sticking 20. Using a fancy pasta cutter, a knife, or even a pizza cutter, cut evenly between the seams of the raviolis to separate them 21. If you used a pasta cutter, you are now done, store the raviolis on a floured wax paper sheet or freeze them for later ![Finished Ravioli](/pix/ravioli-03.webp) 22. If you don't have a pasta cutter, use a fork to press down the dough around the edges of the cut raviolis to ensure they are firmly closed and no leaks or air bubbles are visible, or else they will explode when cooked 23. To cook, throw them in salted boiling water and they will let you know when they're done when they float to the top (1-2 minutes) 24. Serve the seafood version with a simple fresh red sauce and basil, or spice it up a bit and go with a base of red sauce with some added heavy cream, and a pinch of red pepper flakes to make a pink sauce for the seafood version ![Served Ravioli](/pix/ravioli-04.webp)"

Can be useful to get rid of leftover potatoes from the day before. - \u23f2\ufe0f Prep time: 20 min - \ud83c\udf73 Cook time: 20 min - \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Servings: 4",
        "ingredients_source_text": "- ~800g (~1.5lb) potatoes (firm/waxy) - 2 carrots - 500g (~1lb) peas or spinach - 4 eggs - 2 onions (medium size) - butter",
        "directions_source_text": "2. Shred raw or cooked (but cool) potatoes with a grater. The shreds should be   quite large so don't use your typical cheese shredder. 3. Dice the first onion and mix together with potatoes. You can also add diced   bacon if you want to. Add your seasonings here. 4. Heat up some butter in a large pan. Add your mix to the pan on high heat.   Let the mixture get warm for a few minutes under constant stirring. 5. Reduce heat to medium-high. Form the R\u00f6sti into a round cack. It should fill   out the whole pan. I recommend a thickness of around 1 - 1.5cm (~1/2\") for a   softer R\u00f6sti. 6. Add some more butter flakes around the inside of the pan to get it under the   R\u00f6sti. 7. It can take quite a while for a nice crust to form. Check after roughly 5-10   minutes for browning. 8. While the R\u00f6sti is cooking dice the other onion and the carrots. Steam   everything in a pan with a bit of water. Use a lid to get the temperature   up. 9. Alternatively you can use fresh or creamed spinach. 10. When you're satisfied with the browning, flip the R\u00f6sti and set the heat to   medium-low. A plate can be useful here, put it on top of the R\u00f6sti in the   pan and flip. Then gently put the whole cake back in the pan. 11. When the R\u00f6sti crispness is to your liking, remove from pan and fry two   eggs. A runny yolk adds quite a bit to the potatoes. 12. Top R\u00f6sti with eggs and serve with the peas or spinach."
